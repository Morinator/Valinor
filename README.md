# Sourcecode for the animations from [Valinor](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj-6F_YIsOgW0RjxHhYFyQw)

- Welcome to where the magic behind not-so-closed doors happens :)

In this project, we create the animations for our videos, using mainly [manim-community](https://www.manim.community).



We decided to upload our sourcecode as we got alot of requests where people wanted to see how our animations are made.  
If something seems incomprehensible, consider that it may just be bad codeðŸ¥´


## My advice for starters

- You can find everything going from  [manim-community](https://www.manim.community)
- I would try Manim in Google Colab for a few days like
  described [here](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation/jupyter.html#google-colaboratory)
- You don't need to know everything to get started.
- With every new thing to learn, try to make a new animation, so that you remember it.
- Have fun!?

If this repo or especially this README can be improved, write a message on GitHub, Twitter, YT, whatever you like :)
