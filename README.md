- Welcome to where to magic behind not-so-closed doors happens :)

In this project, we create the animations for our videos, using mainly [manim-community](https://www.manim.community).

We decided to upload our sourcecode as we got alot of requests where people wanted to see how our animations are made.  
If something seems incomprehensible, consider that I may just be us being bad programmersðŸ¥´

## My advice for starters

- You can find everything going from  [manim-community](https://www.manim.community)
- I would try Manim in Google Colab for a few days like
  described [here](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation/jupyter.html#google-colaboratory)
- You don't need to know everything to get started.
- With every new thing to learn, try to make a new animation, so that you remember it.
- Have fun!?

If this repo or especially this README can be improved, write a message on GitHub, Twitter, YT, whatever you like :)
