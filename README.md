# Sourcecode for the animations from [Valinor](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj-6F_YIsOgW0RjxHhYFyQw)

- Welcome to where the magic behind not-so-closed doors happens :)

In this project, we create the animations for our videos, using mainly [manim-community](https://www.manim.community).



We decided to upload our sourcecode as we got alot of requests where people wanted to see how our animations are made.  
If something seems incomprehensible, consider that it may just be bad codeðŸ¥´



Below are examples of work we did in this repository:
